# ML_aorta_project
This is a project where I (along with a PhD student) am using ML to predict CFD blood flow within the aorta. The reason being is bevause doing CFD simulations takes so much computing power and time. Therefore using proper orthogonal decomposition we can create reduced order flow model and predict the next time step for the flow and predict velocity and pressure data.
The project is far from complete and the next step is to improve the accuracy by introducing different ML models.
